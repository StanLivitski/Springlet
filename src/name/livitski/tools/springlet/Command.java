/**
 * Extend this class to add a command with optional arguments to
 * the application's command line, or provide the default handler
 * for unclaimed arguments. Subclasses interpret and apply
 * command-line options within the {@link #process(ListIterator)}
 * method. They also provide descriptions of implemented commands
 * or options via {@link #getSummary()} method and list the
 * acceptable arguments via {@link #getArgSpec()} method.
 * These classes don't have to contain full names or shortcuts to
 * the commands they implement, since command names and switches
 * are encoded within the Spring configuration. Each class that
 * implements a command should be declared as a bean in 
 * {@link Launcher#MAIN_BEAN_CONFIG_FILE the framework's configuration}
 * and should have either a name or alias prefixed with
 * {@link Launcher#BEAN_NAME_PREFIX_COMMAND} if it can be entered
 * using the {@link #COMMAND_PREFIX long name} (command) or
 * {@link Launcher#BEAN_NAME_PREFIX_SWITCH} if it can be entered
 * using the {@link #SWITCH_PREFIX short name} (switch). Most commands
 * require an {@link ApplicationBean} to operate on, so they should
 * have it injected using the same configuration file(s). It is not
 * recommended to inject direct references to
 * {@link Launcher#BEAN_NAME_MAIN the main bean}, though, since
 * that bean may be different in dependent projects.
