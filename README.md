What is Springlet?
==================

Springlet is a lightweight [Spring][]-based framework for building command-line
Java applications. Its facilities address basic concerns of a command-line
application, including:

 - Parsing command-line arguments and triggering associated actions
 - Launching the application bean in an [IoC][] container
 - Managing dependency application beans in a composite application
 - Tracking termination status and generating an exit code for a calling script
 - Organizing and configuring the application's logs
 - Displaying the summary of available command-line arguments to the user
 - Simulating the command-line environment during the application testing

Project's dependencies
======================

Springlet uses the libraries listed below. You must have those libraries
on the classpath both when compiling Springlet and using it.

Using Springlet
=============

The simplest example of a Springlet application is located in the `mock/`
directory of this repository.
For detailed Springlet API information, please consult the project's [javadoc][].

        mock/           	An example "Hello, world!" application built using the
        						Springlet framework
        lib/				an empty directory for placing links or copies of
        					 dependency libraries
        LICENSE		        Document that describes the project's licensing terms
        NOTICE   	        A summary of license terms that apply to Springlet
        build.xml      		Configuration file for the tool (Ant) that builds

Building Springlet
================

To build the framework's binary from this repository, you need:

   - A **Java SDK**, also known as JDK, Standard Edition (SE), version 6 or
   later, available from OpenJDK <http://openjdk.java.net/> or Oracle
   <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>.

   Even though a Java runtime may already be installed on your machine
   (check that by running `java --version`), the build will fail if you
   don't have a complete JDK (check that by running `javac`).

   - **Apache Ant** version 1.7.1 or newer, available from the Apache Software
   Foundation <http://ant.apache.org/>.

   - [Dependency libraries](#sec-depends), or links thereto in the `lib/`
   subdirectory of your working copy.

To build the core of Springlet, go to the directory containing a working copy of
Springlet and run:

     ant

The result is a file named `springlet.jar` in the same directory.

<a name="sec-javadoc"> </a>
Building Javadoc
================

To build Javadoc for the project, make sure you have met the prerequisites
[listed above](#sec-building), go to the directory containing a working copy of
project's sources and run:

     ant javadoc

The result will be placed in the `javadoc` subdirectory.
